# mod3d_gl_sdl_example

This provides an SDL2-based executable that provides a GLTF file viewer, with shaders specified and loaded
loaded at run-time.

It is a very basic (and pretty poorly structured, currently) example of using mod3d_base/gl/gtf.

## Usage


```
cargo add mod3d_gl_sdl_example
```

(or possibly cargo install instead)
