# mod3d_gl_wasm_example

A library that builds a WASM WebGpu-based Gltf viewer, with shaders
loaded at run-time.

It is a very basic (and pretty poorly structured, currently) example of using mod3d_base/gl/gltf.

It is built using the 'mk' script (since it needs the Wasm pack utility)

## Usage


```
cargo add mod3d_gl_wasm_example
```
